Agonia
=======

A CLI implementation of Agonia, a card game well known in Greece.

Game rules
-----------
Initially 7 cards are dealt to each player and one card stays down. Players
must play one card on their turn. A card can be played if it has the same number
or same suit with the down card. If a player cannot play a card, he should pull
one from the deck and if he still can't play, he folds. Winner is the one to
get rid of all of his cards first.

Special cards:

-A : The player that played an Ace chooses the suit of the down card.
     Aces can be played at any state of the game independently of the down card.
-8 : When one played, the opponent looses his turn.
-7 : When one played, the opponent has to pull 2 cards from the deck.
     If opponent also has a 7, first player will pull 4 cards (or 6, 8 for any 7 on 7).
